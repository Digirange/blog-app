<Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='xl' align='center'>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</Text><br />

<Text fontSize='l'>Today, I would like to talk about how I recently obtained an certification in Amazon's Web Services (AWS). It is their Developer Associate certification. Amazon currently offers three different certifications on their associate level. The other two are their Solutions Architect and SysOps Administrator. Starting at the end of February 2023, they are releasing the new versions of their associate level exams, in which I plan to obtain the remaining two before the year's end. The goal, after obtaining all three associate level exams, I am going to pursue and obtain Amazon's DevOps Engineer professional certification. Writing out and setting goals for myself combined with Amazon's structured learning path has made this learning journey realistic for me. This is part of the reason I decided to go with learning Amazon's cloud opposed to other platforms such as Azure, Oracle, etc. Along with, being more familiar with AWS from previous years of going in and testing their services within the free tier.</Text><br/>
    
<Text fontSize='l'>For anyone interested, AWS offers a free tier for your first year of your account, so that you can go in and test whatever you would like on a small scale while costing you nothing. You do have to be aware of what you are doing, so you don't accrue charges, but the platform does a good job of telling you what is included in the free tier and what is not. For study material, I used purchased courses from Udemy as well as purchased practice test. I feel I made the right choice for stufy material as those practice exams really geared me up to take the test.</Text><br />

<Text fontSize='l'>And for some even better news, I have officially moved this blog onto the AWS platform! I chose to use the AWS service called Elastic Beanstalk. The reason I chose to use EB (Elastic Beanstalk) as the service for my first app on AWS was because of how hands off it is. Everything from load balancing, provisioning the right amount of instances, to logging and reporting. Elastic beanstalk takes care of it all. I would recommend EB to anyone if it is their first time deploying an app to AWS.</Text><br/>

<Text fontSize='l'>I will continue to improve this blog as I continue to learn more and more every day. Just to name a couple of updates I plan to make soon are, Implementing CI/CD for this app through AWS. Amazon offers a service to help with this called CodePipeline. There are many options associated with CodePipeline, however the main two I would consider would be CodeBuild and CodeDeploy. They both do exactly what their names implies. They build code and then deploy with the help of CodePipeline. The moment I make updates to my GitHub repo, the pipeline begins and starts the process. Once this is completed, the next task for myself is to purchase and assign a domain name through another service AWS offers called Route 53. These are my two immediate updates that I am currently working on.</Text><br/>
