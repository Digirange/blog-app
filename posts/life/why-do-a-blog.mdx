<Heading fontSize='75px'> Why Even Do A Blog? </Heading><br />


<Text fontSize='xl'>This might be a question you might've asked yourself if you ever thought about doing one. I know for sure I have. That's when I started to read blogs for myself and see what they were about. Majority of the ones I read were sports blogs and just one gaming related one. But that's when it really clicked for me. I LOVE to hear other people's opinions and thoughts on subjects of my interest. Whether it is in the form of a blog, podcast, or just simply having a conversation with someone.</Text><br />

<Text fontSize='xl'>I'd describe myself as someone who likes to look at things of interest from all point of views and not just base everything off my initial opinion. I am firm believer of changing my opinion on a matter after reading more or listening to someone if it resonates with me. I encourage everyone to always have an open mind on topics, because every context is different no matter how similar
 the subject is.</Text><br />

<Text fontSize='xl'>What I am really looking to gain from blogging is to share my views, thoughts, and life to the world. I'd love to hear other's opinions on my blogs. Maybe this will inspire me to even get into vlogging and not just blogging. Not sure where this is really going to go, but what I do know is I am going to enjoy the ride. I believe just getting your thoughts out whether you write them down or verbally discuss them, is great for your soul. Thank you for taking time out of your life, to read a little about mine. As always, stay golden pony boy.</Text><br />
