<Heading fontSize='75px'> Just a Random Thursday </Heading><br />


<Text fontSize='xl'>Today I woke up having a feeling like I figured it out. Figured out what exactly? Honestly, I couldn't even put it in words. However, this feeling is great. I have felt it throughout my short life a couple of times. Sometimes it has come before I take a great leap in my career, while other times it could be
finally beating that level in a video game, wrapping my head around a coding techinqiue, near my daughter's birth.</Text><br />

<Text fontSize='xl'>This feeling comes in so many different forms, but the feelings it makes me feel, the anxiety fazing away .. feeling myself become confident and content, the pure excitement..is always the same.</Text><br />

<Text fontSize='xl'>I'm going take this feeling and apply myself. I owe it to myself.</Text><br/>
