At the time of me leaving the company, I had automated about 85% of my job with powershell scripts that I had created myself. Now, I am looking to fully dive into the world of coding and become a web developer. I\u2019ve been spending the majority of my time improving my skills with Front-End Masters. If you\u2019re not familiar with FEM (Front-End Masters), it is a subscription based learning platform for web development, where they teach and guide you on how to use and understand modern development technologies.
